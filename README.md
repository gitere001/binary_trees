# Binary Tree Learning Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Binary Tree Learning Repository! This repository is designed to provide comprehensive learning materials and resources for understanding binary trees and related concepts. Whether you're a beginner or seeking to deepen your understanding, this repository offers clear explanations, practical examples, and exercises to facilitate your learning journey.

## Description

This repository serves as a learning hub for understanding the fundamental concepts of binary trees and exploring their applications in computer science and software engineering. It includes detailed explanations, code examples, and exercises to help learners grasp the concepts effectively.

## What is a Binary Tree?

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure comprising nodes, where each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. The topmost node in the tree is known as the root node.

## Difference Between Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a specific type of binary tree in which the values of the nodes in the left subtree are less than the value of the parent node, and the values of the nodes in the right subtree are greater than the value of the parent node. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Gain Compared to Linked Lists

Binary trees offer significant advantages over linked lists in terms of time complexity for various operations, such as searching, insertion, and deletion. For example, searching in a binary search tree has an average time complexity of O(log n), whereas searching in a linked list has a time complexity of O(n).

## Depth, Height, and Size of a Binary Tree

- **Depth**: The depth of a node in a binary tree is the length of the path from the root node to that node.
- **Height**: The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.
- **Size**: The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes in the tree.

## Traversal Methods

Various traversal methods are used to navigate through a binary tree, including:
- **Inorder Traversal**
- **Preorder Traversal**
- **Postorder Traversal**
- **Level-order Traversal**

## Types of Binary Trees

- **Complete Binary Tree**
- **Full Binary Tree**
- **Perfect Binary Tree**
- **Balanced Binary Tree**
